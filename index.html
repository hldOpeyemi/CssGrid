                <p>Although considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian
                jollof rice includes long-grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste,
                pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are
                cooked in one pot, of which a rich meat stock and a fried tomato and pepper
                puree characteristically forms the base.</p>

                <p>Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served 
                    with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed 
                    vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc. 
                    In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein,
                    seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice.</p>

                onion, red pepper, garlic, ginger and Scotch bonnet chili peppers. 
                To enhance the colour of the dish, tomato paste (pur√©e) is added. As seasoning, spices, 
                salt, stock cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder 
                and dried thyme are used. To complement the dish, chicken, turkey,
